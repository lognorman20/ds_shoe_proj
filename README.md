# StockX Sneaker Price Prediction Project

In this notebook, I will perform regression to predict the price of a given sneaker based on several factors such as order date, brand, sneaker name, sale price, and several others. This dataset is directly from StockX and was used for their 2019 data competition. 

### Description from StockX:

The data we’re giving you consists of a random sample of all Off-White x Nike and Yeezy 350 sales from between 9/1/2017 (the month that Off-White first debuted “The Ten” collection) and the present. There are 99,956 total sales in the data set; 27,794 Off-White sales, and 72,162 Yeezy sales. The sample consists of U.S. sales only.

To create this sample, we took a random, fixed percentage of StockX sales (X%) for each colorway, on each day, since September 2017. So, for each day the Off-White Jordan 1 was on the market, we randomly selected X% of its sale from each day. (It’s not important to know what X is; all that matters is that it’s a random sample, and that the same fixed X% of sales was selected from every day, for every sneaker).

We’ve included 8 variables for you to work with: Order Date, Brand, Sneaker Name, Sale Price ($), Retail Price ($), Release Date, Shoe Size, and Buyer State (the U.S. state the buyer shipped to). You can use whatever variables you want in the analysis; you can use 1 variable, or you can use all 8. And remember, every row in the spreadsheet represents an individual StockX sale. There are no averages or order counts; this is just a random sample of daily sales data.
